#LOG735

This project uses [gradle][1] to manage dependencies and build artifacts. It is divided in 2 sub projects the client and
the repository (which in our case act as the Zookeeper).

I recommend using [Jetbrains IntelliJ][2] as the IDE for this project since it integrates well with [gradle][1] and 
offers an awesome coverage of java. **Note: IntelliJ can use the gradle wrapper that will automatically download 
gradle.**
